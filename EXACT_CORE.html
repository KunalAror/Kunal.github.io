    <h1>CoreExact Algorithm Time Complexity reducing the Time Complexity of Exact Algorithm</h1>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The CoreExact algorithm enhances the Exact method by significantly reducing its
        computational cost. It uses core decomposition and pruning techniques to focus on smaller, denser subgraphs,
        rather than recalculating flow networks for the entire graph during every binary search iteration. By working
        within (k, Ψ)-cores, CoreExact efficiently narrows down the search to parts of the graph where the Connected
        Dominating Set (CDS) is likely to be, drastically reducing unnecessary computations.

        Additionally, CoreExact tightens the bounds on the search parameter α, which reduces the number of binary search
        iterations needed to find the CDS. As the search progresses, the algorithm gradually works with smaller and more
        relevant subgraphs, minimizing the cost of maximum flow computations and improving scalability. These
        optimizations allow CoreExact to compute the CDS with significantly less time and computational effort than the
        Exact algorithm, making it more practical for larger graphs.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tighter bounds on α</strong>: By analyzing (k, Ψ)-cores, tighter lower and upper bounds for the
            search parameter α are computed, reducing the number of binary search iterations needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Locating the CDS inside cores</strong>: Instead of searching the entire graph, CoreExact narrows the
            search to specific (k, Ψ)-cores where the CDS is guaranteed to exist, based on the graph's clique-density
            properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrinking flow networks</strong>: As binary search progresses and α increases, CoreExact dynamically
            switches to smaller subgraphs with higher core numbers, minimizing the size of the flow networks and thus
            lowering the cost of minimum cut computations.</li>
    </ul>
    By combining these three techniques, CoreExact builds much smaller flow networks, performs fewer binary search
    steps, and ultimately finds the exact CDS much faster than the original Exact algorithm.

    Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of CoreExact depends on the maximum size of the cores and the efficiency of minimum cut
    computations.
    Assuming core decomposition takes
    <span>O(mh<sup>h-2</sup>)</span> time and that maximum flow is computed using efficient algorithms like Dinic’s
    algorithm
    <span>O(m<sup>n</sup>)</span>, the overall time is significantly less than Exact, especially when graphs are sparse
    or have strong core
    structures.
