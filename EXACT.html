    <h1>Exact Algorithm for Connected Dominating Set (CDS) Computation</h1>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong>The Exact algorithm computes the Connected Dominating Set (CDS) of a graph by
        iteratively solving a maximum flow problem combined with binary search. It exploits the fundamental relationship
        between maximum flow and minimum cut in flow networks to accurately identify the minimal CDS.
        In this approach, the graph structure is carefully transformed into a flow network where clique structures and
        node degrees influence the edge capacities. By setting up the problem as a sequence of flow computations with
        gradually adjusted thresholds, the algorithm can systematically search for the smallest CDS that satisfies the
        connectivity and domination requirements. The binary search ensures efficiency by narrowing the feasible
        solution space in logarithmic time, while the minimum cut calculation at each step ensures that the solution
        remains exact.

        <br> The key steps of the Exact algorithm are summarized as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Initializing binary search bounds <em>l</em> and <em>u</em> based on the maximum degree of vertices.</li>

        <li>Identifying all (h‚àí1)-cliques in <em>G</em> to form auxiliary nodes.</li>

        <li>Building a <strong>flow network</strong> <em>F(V<sub>F</sub>, E<sub>F</sub>)</em> for each binary search
            iteration, consisting of:
            <ul>
                <li>A source node <em>s</em>, sink node <em>t</em>,</li>
                <li>Original vertices <em>V</em>,</li>
                <li>(h‚àí1)-cliques <em>Œõ</em> as intermediate nodes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Setting edge capacities according to graph properties and candidate threshold <em>Œ±</em>.</li>

        <li>Solving a <strong>minimum s-t cut</strong> to determine the feasibility of the current solution.</li>

        <li>Updating the search range based on the cut result until convergence.</li>
